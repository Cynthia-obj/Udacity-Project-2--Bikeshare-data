# Udacity-Project-2--Bikeshare-data
## Description

In this project, i made use of Python codeto explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
